to compile/install on OpenBSD, do the following:

1. install dependency packages : imlib2 docbook2x libtool cairo mpd scons lua51
2. cd to conky-1.9.0 folder (if you use conky-1.9.0 from sourceforge, apply OpenBSD patches to make it compile. source files in this repo are already patched)
3. compile tolua++ ( by running 'scons all && scons install' in the tolua++-1.0.9 folder)
4. run autogen.sh
5. run myconfig.sh
6. run make
7. run make install
8. run "cd lua && make install"
9. cd /usr/local/lib/conky && ln -s libcairo.so.*.* libcairo.so
10. pick your conky rc file and give it a try
